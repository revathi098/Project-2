        <center><h1>FoodFest</h1></center>
        <p><A foodie is a person who has an ardent or refined interest in food,[1] and who eats food not only out of hunger but also as a hobby.<br> The related terms "gastronome" and "gourmet" define roughly the same thing, i.e. a person who enjoys food for pleasure; the connotation of "foodie" differs slightly—a sort of everyman with a love for food culture and different foods. <br>Some, such as Paul Levy, say the foodie can still be a "foodist".<br>
            Earliest uses of the word
            The "foodie" — not as elitist as a gourmet, more discriminating than a glutton — was first named in print in the early 1980s.</p>

           <p>Foodies are a distinct hobbyist group. Typical foodie interests and activities include the food industry, wineries and wine tasting, breweries and beer sampling, food science, following restaurant openings and closings and occasionally reopenings, food distribution, food fads, health and nutrition, cooking classes, culinary tourism, and restaurant management.</p>
           <p>Foodies have a significant social media presence; food lovers have created their own YouTube channels where they show what they cook and where they eat around the world.[8] It has also become a common practice to take photos of food and beverages consumed at home or outside and share them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other media in a form of food porn.[9]</p>
